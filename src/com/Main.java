/**
 * author: crs
 * description: entry target for application.  gives example for how to use transactionally-boosted set,
 *              as some setup is required with generating callables for the operations.
 *              main purpose is to vary over the number of threads operations will be executed on,
 *              and the proportions of operations (add / remove / contains) that will be generated.
 *              log metrics for performance benchmarking.
 *
 * Edit History:
 * - Renovated by crs on 4/7/17.
 *
 * Updates:
 * - changes to how callables are being generated
 * - operations and inverses are now generated in advance of running the simulation for the configuration
 * - refactored method of logging
 *
